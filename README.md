**FlowDraw** is a collaborative drawing and whiteboard platform built for real-time creativity and low-latency collaboration. Create canvases, invite teammates, and draw together ‚Äî or open a private, solo document for personal sketches. Focused on performance, security, and a clean UX, FlowDraw ships with persistent storage for shapes and an ephemeral real-time layer for smooth interactions.

## üöÄ Quick summary

- **Real-time collaborative whiteboard** with live cursors and instant sync.
- **Solo mode** for private documents.
- **Persistent shape storage** in PostgreSQL (Prisma) + ephemeral real-time synchronization via WebSocket server.
- **Secure sign-in** using Google OAuth + JWT via NextAuth.js.

## üîß Getting started (development)

> These instructions assume a monorepo layout and `pnpm` usage (you can adapt to `npm`/`yarn`).

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flowdraw.git
cd flowdraw
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Create environment files

Create `.env` in the frontend (or repo root depending on your setup). Example variables:

```env
# NextAuth / Auth
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_random_secret
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret

# Public urls
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=https://flowdraw-ws.onrender.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/flowdraw
```

4. Prepare the database (Prisma)

```bash
# generate client
pnpm --filter packages/db prisma generate

# run migrations
pnpm --filter packages/db prisma migrate dev --name init
```

5. Start the WebSocket server (realtime layer)

Open a terminal for the WebSocket server (see `/packages/ws`) and run the dev command used in your repo (for example):

```bash
cd apps/ws-server
pnpm dev
```

6. Start the frontend

```bash
pnpm --filter apps/web dev
```

7. Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

## üß© Architecture overview

1. **Frontend (Next.js)** handles UI, authentication, and user interactions. It keeps a local operational log + optimistic updates for a snappy UX.
2. **WebSocket Server** receives events (create shape, update, delete, presence, undo/redo operations) and relays them to other clients in the room.
3. **Database (Postgres + Prisma)** is used to persist shapes and document metadata. The server writes snapshots or discrete shape records so documents are restorable.

---

## üîê Security & Auth

- Google OAuth is handled via NextAuth. Sessions are JWT-backed with a `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`.
- Authorization checks are enforced on the server for document access (owner/members-only). The WebSocket server validates JWTs before allowing socket connections.
